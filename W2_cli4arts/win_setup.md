# Windows Notes
The default windows shell, Powershell, is a piece of trash that nobody uses.

It is suggested to download the [Windows Terminal App](https://apps.microsoft.com/detail/9N0DX20HK701?hl=en-US&gl=US) and the use this to install [Windows Subsystem for Linux, WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/about). This creates a virtual linux system on your machine.

Doing this will give an environment that matches the demos done on the Mac Terminal or in Replit!

You can even run Homebrew, which allows you to easily install packages and manage multiple versions of them! Checkout [this post](https://medium.com/@edwardbaeg9/using-homebrew-on-windows-10-with-windows-subsystem-for-linux-wsl-c7f1792f88b3). **Untested by me**
