# Week 8 - Pico LEDS 

## Python Crash Course
Check out [my python crash course](./W7_microcontrollers/python.md) for getting started with CircuitPython.

## Follow These Tutorials
Go through these tutorials on adafruit. They are consecutive and build on each other.
- [Blinky and a Button](https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi-pico-circuitpython/blinky-and-a-button)
- [Traffic Light](https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi-pico-circuitpython/traffic-light-and-pedestrian-crossing)

Bonus, if you have time.
- [Reaction Game](https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi-pico-circuitpython/reaction-game)

And a Challenge! 
- [LED dimemr](https://learn.adafruit.com/getting-started-with-raspberry-pi-pico-circuitpython/potentiometer-and-pwm-led)

## Show and Tell for Next Week
Use your pico and LED to create a light animation. Get creative! You can use the lights to animate a scene or something.
Add a video and a screenshot of your code to the slideshow shared in Canvas.

## Pico Code 
[Here](https://github.com/awdriggs-teach/SVA-CS2-24/tree/main/microcontrollers/pico_code) is a folder with all the examples for class.
