# Week 11 - AI Image classifier

## Resources 
- [Teachable Machine](https://teachablemachine.withgoogle.com/), train a machine learning model to recognize images, poses, or sounds.
- [P5 + ML5 + Teachable Machine](https://editor.p5js.org/codingtrain/sketches/PoZXqbu4v), starter code, update to match you model.
- Coding Train Videos - [Part 1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kwcillcWOg0) and [Part 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UPgxnGC8oBU)
- Step by Step guide to train then import into Scratch block coding environment [Guide](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tL199IlBh2bB4sCVEEMlRxyptnM3dZuPTSBp19SIKLQ/copy). I'm recycling this guide from something I made for my HS students so feel free to ignore parts that don't feel applicable.
